# Impact-of-COVID-on-markets

This research paper focuses on the influence of Covid-19 on the Chinese stock market and the United States stock market. The purpose of this research is to figure out the differences between the Chinese stock market and the United States stock market when faced with the Covid-19 influence and why the Covid-19 has a bigger influence on the United States stock market than the Chinese stock market. The research includes three stock market indices from both countries in the first 100 days of Covid-19 started. It has two main objectives. The first one is the direct impact of Covid-19 that causes the difference reaction between the Chinese stock market and the United States Stock Market. Second is the indirect impact of Covid-19 on two countries such as lockdown policy (home stay policy) that results in the different stock market changes. We used stack regression as the method to analyze the reason for the difference in the stock market of both countries.
